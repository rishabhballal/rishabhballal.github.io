          <h2>Geometric models</h2>
          <p>One naturally visualises a geometric structure in 3-dimensional space (R<sup>3</sup>). How then does the mathematician understand an <i>n</i>-dimensional structure in the absence of an ambient space? In the first step towards an intrinsic formulation that reflects the underlying geometry, the mathematician develops the notion of a <i>manifold</i>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Bearing a remarkable analogy with the subject of geography, an <i>n</i>-dimensional manifold is defined by an <i>atlas</i>, which is a collection of <i>charts</i>. Each chart assigns coordinates to a region of the manifold, such that the atlas covers the manifold.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The simplest examples are some familiar 2-dimensional manifolds, as shown below. (For the code behind the models, refer: <a href='#geometric-models-code' class='link'>constructing 3D models using canvas in JavaScript</a>.)</p>

            <h2>The Sphere</h2>
            <p>A representation of perhaps the most interesting symmetry in Nature, the sphere carves its way into most fields of physics. In geometry, it is the standard example of positive curvature, and is also simply-connected, which means that any closed curve on its surface can be continuously contracted to a point on the same curve.</p>

            <h2>The Hyperboloid</h2>
            <p>Contrary to the sphere, the hyperboloid is the standard example of negative curvature, and finds itself primarily amongst cosmological models. Depicted alongside is the one-sheeted version, which is connected unlike the two-sheeted hyperboloid.</p>

            <h2>The Torus</h2>
            <p>More popularly known as the donut, the torus is constructed by assigning a circle to each point of another circle. As any closed curve that wraps around the torus cannot be contracted to a point, the torus only differs from the sphere in that it is not simply-connected.</p>

            <h2>The Möbius Strip</h2>
            <p>Having only one edge and one surface, the Möbius strip is a non-orientable manifold; traversing the strip results in an inversion of axis orientation after each loop. One can model the Möbius strip by recognising its boundary as a closed curve on the torus.</p>

          <h2>Constructing 3D models using canvas in JavaScript</h2>
          <p>Since there are multiple models on this site, object-oriented programming eliminates repetitive code. That particular approach can be found in the <span class='code bg-grey'>models.js</span> file on the <a href='https://github.com/rishabhballal/rishabhballal.github.io' target='_blank' class='link'>Github repository for this site</a>. Given here, for simplicity, is a sequential breakdown of a single model - the torus.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Canvas initialisation</h3>
          <p>The <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API' target='_blank' class='link'>Canvas API</a> is used to create graphics in JavaScript and render them in HTML. Lines 5-6 centre the canvas origin and invert the Y-axis, so as to work in the usual Cartesian coordinate system.</p>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rishabhballal/eb612f0072bf3e330e9af38625308fca.js"></script>
          <br>
          <h3>Coordinates</h3>
          <p>From its mathematical identification with the direct product of two circles (or by simple visual intuition), the torus needs only two angles <span class='code'>phi</span> and <span class='code'>theta</span> to parameterize its coordinates. Conversion of the coordinates from spherical to Cartesian is given by the equations in lines 12-14.</p>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rishabhballal/bd6c19cca6d7f2999ce7d04592c0f377.js"></script>
          <br>
          <h3>Orientation</h3>
          <p>Rotating the model can provide a better view. This is done by multiplying each coordinate with a chosen <i>rotation matrix</i>. Although not immediately obvious, the general rotation equations given in lines 5-7 result from the cyclic nature of Cartesian coordinates.</p>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rishabhballal/422f48f8980965326ebcbff7b6cbbe13.js"></script>
          <br>
          <h3>Stereographic projection</h3>
          <p>In the final step, it is necessary to plot 3-dimensional coordinates on a 2-dimensional screen. Projection eliminates the third coordinate, but not before encoding its information in the first two coordinates.</p>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/rishabhballal/161189b5cd837752712f3a76d3c4d67a.js"></script>
          <p>As can be seen in the equations of <i>stereographic projection</i> on lines 3-4, the projected coordinates are proportional to the first two coordinates, scaled by a factor which depends on the third. The variable <span class='code'>dist</span> represents the distance, in the direction of the third coordinate, from which one is observing the model. If it is too small, the projection will diverge to infinity, and if it is too large, it will not lend the perspective of depth. The remaining lines of code exhibit simple use of the canvas context in drawing lines that connect the coordinates.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Compiling the above four snippets of code will yield the torus model as shown amongst the <a href='#geometric-models' class='link'>geometric models</a>, while the other models can be recreated with an appropriate modification of the coordinate equations.</p>
